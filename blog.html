            </header>
            <p>
              <h4>1. BACKGROUND:</h4>
                I am passionate about the bond between a dog and its human. That type of unique, unconditional love is something everyone should experience.</br>
                Pupple is a simple, easy to use app to match potential pets with the right person.</br>
                Pupple will ask the user about their lifestyle, activity level, home/living situation, interests, etc. to match them with the best canine companion.</br>
                The results will be fewer BUT more compatible.</br>
            </br>
              <h4>2. INTRODUCTION:</h4>
                The following app was developed for the final capstone project for my web development bootcamp.</br>
                There are many dog adoption match sites. This app was intended to produce less but more</br>
                accurate matches for the user. The design decisions and assumptions are solely based on</br>
                publicy available information.</br>
            </br>
              <h4>3. TEAM:</h4>
                Pamela Yuhas</br>
            </br>
              <h4>4. RESEARCH / EMPATHIZE WITH OTHERS:</h4>
              I had family, friends, and classmates look at three different dog adoption match sites. I asked</br>
              them to verbalize their thoughts while browsing the sites. I also told them to inform me of any</br>
              opinions from past personal usage of these or similar sites.</br>
              It quickly became apparent that each participant thought these types of sites were oversaturated</br>
              with never-ending lists of options.</br>
            </br>
              <h4>5. USER STORIES / PERSONAS:</h4>
              I created three different user stories to highlight different possible scenarios for who might</br>
              be looking to adopt a dog. At first, they were made-up people that had fabricated backgrounds,</br>
              jobs, etc. The day before presenting for the final capstone project at Galvanize, I decided to</br>
              make these stories a little more fun and familiar by using well-loved movie characters.</br>
            </br>
              <h4>6. REEVALUATE / DISTILL YOUR FINDINGS:</h4>
              It's important to take a step back to reassess and reexamine what it is you're trying to achieve,</br>
              and what you're trying to accomplish as the end goal for the user.

            </br>
              <h4>7. SKETCH / ORGANIZE:</h4>
              I drew out the user flow to better see what the user should see.
              <img src="images/projects/puppleorganize.jpg" alt="sketch"></br>
            </br>
              <h4>8. LO-FI WIREFRAME:</h4>
              Combining the diagram and sketches, I developed wireframes to see clear structure and layout.
              <img src="images/projects/pupplelofi.png" alt="wireframes done by program">
            </br>
              <h4>9. TAKEAWAYS:</h4>
              It's hard to pretend you're looking to adopt a dog and make a large commitment when you are not.</br>
              You can only try so hard to design features for others when your own experiences are always with</br>
              you. Personally, I have used these sites and apps, but you can never 100% know the true experience</br>
              until you're actually looking for your new, furry friend.</br>
            </br>
              <h4>10. FUTURE:</h4>
              I would like to make Pupple a one-stop shop where users can go to fulfill every pet-parent need.</br>

      <h3><a href="https://marvelapp.com/eie925e">Getaway! Travel App</a></h3>
    </header>
    <p>
      <h4>1. BACKGROUND:</h4>
        Getaway! is a travel app where the user is given a personalized itinerary to get the most out</br>
        of their trip.</br>
    </br>
      <h4>2. INTRODUCTION:</h4>
        The following app was developed for a user experience bootcamp that I participated in</br>
        at General Assembly. The design decisions and assumptions are solely based on</br>
        publicy available information.</br>
    </br>
      <h4>3. TEAM:</h4>
        Pamela Yuhas</br>
    </br>
      <h4>4. RESEARCH / EMPATHIZE WITH OTHERS:</h4>
      The task was to interview two classmates. I was to ask either about a trip they loved so </br>
      much they would repeat it or the worst trip they've been on. I asked questions about who</br>
      they were on the trip with, what the purpose of the trip was, what they liked/disliked about</br>
      the surroundings, what activities they did, if they had any memorable moments during the</br>
      trip, what the weather was like, etc.</br>
      I paid special attention to any emotions mentioned.
      <img src="images/projects/getawayempathize.jpg" alt="">
    </br>
      <h4>5. USER STORIES / PERSONAS:</h4>
      I formed the two interviews into general personas. This helped give me a clearer picture</br>
      of the different types of people this app could benefit. Identifying different needs and goals</br>
      was an integral part of making the app applicable to a larger audience.
      <img src="images/projects/getawaypersonas.jpg" alt="">
    </br>
      <h4>6. REEVALUATE / DISTILL YOUR FINDINGS:</h4>
      It's important to remember what the main problems or issues are. I took a step back to</br>
      reassess what the user's main motivators may be and what problem they need to</br>
      overcome.
      <img src="images/projects/getawaydistill.jpg" alt="">
    </br>
      <h4>7. SKETCH / ORGANIZE:</h4>
      I mapped out the user flow to help visualize the possible click routes the user could take.
      <img src="images/projects/getawayorganize.jpg" alt="">
    </br>
      <h4>8. LO-FI WIREFRAME:</h4>
      After doing a quick sketch of the possible layout, I used Marvel to help visualize what the</br>
      app could potentially look like.
      <div class="lofihifi">
        <img src="images/projects/lofi1.png" alt="">
        <img src="images/projects/lofi2.png" alt="">
        <img src="images/projects/lofi3.png" alt="">
      </div>
      <div class="lofihifi">
        <img src="images/projects/lofi4.png" alt="">
        <img src="images/projects/lofi5.png" alt="">
        <img src="images/projects/lofi6.png" alt="">
      </div>
    </br>
      <h4>9. HI-FI WIREFRAME:</h4>
      I then created a simple hi-fi mock-up to bring my vision to the next level.
      <div class="lofihifi">
        <img src="images/projects/hifi1.png" alt="">
        <img src="images/projects/hifi2.png" alt="">
        <img src="images/projects/hifi4.png" alt="">
        <img src="images/projects/hifi3.png" alt="">
      </div>
    </br>
      <h4>10. TAKEAWAYS:</h4>
      People travel for various reasons. If you can narrow down the information to better suit the</br>
      user then they will find more ease in traveling and would be more likely to be a returning</br>
      customer. This app needs to be just as efficient for someone planning a family vacation as</br>
      someone traveling for work.</br>
    </br>
      <h4>11. FUTURE:</h4>
      I would like to make Getaway! an extremely attainable app. I want it to feel like a good friend</br>
      who knows you well and can easily plan out your trip. The app needs to obtain the proper</br>
      information so the user can successfully achieve the purpose of their trip.</br>
